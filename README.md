`.loom` is an efficient file format for very large omics datasets, 
consisting of a main matrix and a variable number of row and column 
annotations. We use loom files to store single-cell gene expression 
data: the main matrix contains the actual expression values (one 
column per cell, one row per gene); row and column annotations 
contain metadata for genes and cells, such as `Name`, `Chromosome`, 
`Position` (for genes), and `Strain`, `Sex`, `Age` (for cells).

Loom files (`.loom`) are created in the [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) file format, which 
supports an internal collection of numerical multidimensional datasets.
HDF5 is supported by many computer languages, including Java, MATLAB, 
Mathematica, Python, R, and Julia. `.loom` files are accessible from 
any language that supports HDF5.

## Installation

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) from your terminal:

```bash
pip install loompy
```

**Note:** there are some prerequisites, which will be installed along with loompy. If you 
use the popular [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) Python distribution, all prerequisites will have
already been installed. 

## Getting started
 
```python
import loom
ds = loom.connect("cortex.loom")
print ds.row_attrs.keys()
```

This will print the names of all the row attribute in the file. 

## Understanding the semantics of loom files

### Connecting, not loading and saving

Loom files are stored on disk and are never loaded entirely. They
are more like databases: you connect, retrieve some subset of the data,
maybe update some attributes.

### Reading and writing

Loom files are based on [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format), a file format suitable for large multidimensional
datasets. They are designed to be mostly created once, then used as read-only. 
They **do not** support writing and reading concurrently. They also
do no support journalling, so if something happens during a write, the 
**entire file can be lost**. Therefore, do not use loom files as 
your primary data storage. They are for working with data, not keeping 
it safe.

Loom files are great for distribution of large datasets, which are then
used as read-only for analytical purposes.

### Efficient indexing

The main matrix is stored in *chunked* format. That is, instead of being
stored by rows or by columns, it is stored as a sequence of little rectangles. 
As a consequence, both rows and columns (as well as submatrices) can be efficiently 
accessed.
